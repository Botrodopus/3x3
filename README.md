# Cubes

Solves a 3x3 Rubik's cube the way a human would.

Version 1 is inefficient and a bit inconsistent, I wrote all of it senior year of high school during my non-cs classes.

Version 2 takes the same steps for solving as v1, but does so slightly more efficiently and very accurately. I wrote the whole thing without testing it because I thought that would be a fun thing to try, it needs a bit of debugging...

So far, these programs use the beginner's method, but my ultimate goal is to code the more advanced and efficient methods.
